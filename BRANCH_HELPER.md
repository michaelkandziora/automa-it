### Branching Guide for the "automa-it" Project

---

## Overview

Branching is a key aspect of collaborative development. It allows multiple developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without impacting each other's work. This guide outlines the branching strategy for the "automa-it" project, helping you manage branches efficiently.

## Branching Strategy

### Main Branch

The `main` branch represents the latest stable release. This branch should always reflect a production-ready state. 

### Development Branch

The `develop` branch serves as the integration branch for the next release cycle. Features and bugfixes should be merged here before being released.

### Feature Branches

Feature branches are used for developing new features. They should branch off from `develop` and should be merged back into `develop` when the feature is complete.

### Bugfix Branches

Bugfix branches are used for quick fixes that should be included in the upcoming release. They branch off from `develop` and are merged back into `develop`.

### Hotfix Branches

Hotfix branches are used for critical bug fixes that need immediate attention. They branch off from `main` and are merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

## Creating Branches

### From the Development Branch

To create a feature or bugfix branch, start from `develop`:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### From the Main Branch

To create a hotfix branch, start from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bugfix
```

## Merging Branches

### Into the Development Branch

To merge a feature or bugfix branch into `develop`:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin develop
```

### Into the Main Branch

To merge a hotfix branch into `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge hotfix/critical-bugfix
git push origin main
```

## Deleting Branches

After merging, you can delete the feature, bugfix, or hotfix branch:

```bash
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
```

For remote branches:

```bash
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

## Pull Requests

### Creating a Pull Request

After creating a branch and pushing your changes, open a pull request on GitHub:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click "Compare & pull request".
3. Add a descriptive title and detailed description.
4. Choose the correct target branch (`develop` or `main`).
5. Click "Create pull request".

### Reviewing a Pull Request

1. Review the code changes and leave comments if necessary.
2. Approve the pull request if everything looks good.

## Branch Naming Conventions

- **Feature branches:** `feature/your-feature-name`
- **Bugfix branches:** `bugfix/your-bugfix-name`
- **Hotfix branches:** `hotfix/your-hotfix-name`

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Branches Short-Lived:** Create branches for specific tasks and merge them back as soon as possible.
2. **Use Descriptive Names:** Name branches based on the feature, bugfix, or hotfix.
3. **Update Often:** Regularly pull changes from the base branch to keep your branch up-to-date.
4. **Use Pull Requests:** Always create a pull request to merge changes, allowing for code review.

## Glossary

- **Branch:** A pointer to a snapshot of your changes. Allows you to work on multiple versions of a project.
- **Merge:** The process of integrating changes from one branch into another.
- **Pull Request:** A request to merge changes from one branch to another.
- **Staging:** The area where files are prepared before committing.
